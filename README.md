# gravity_guy

Started out as a first go at creating a game with a space theme and gravity using Flame game engine. 

Has become a longer term project.

Plan as of now...
- Polish up the rocky moon starting sequence.
- Have an explorable space station. Have a couple of mini-quests.
- Release on Itch.io for a dollar.
